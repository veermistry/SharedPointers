Shared Pointers
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a simple shared pointer, named Shared, providing basic memory management capabilities through reference counting.

Overview
The Shared class is a template class designed to manage the lifecycle of dynamically allocated objects. It employs a reference counting mechanism to automatically handle memory deallocation when the last reference to the object is released.

Features
- Reference Counting: The shared pointer keeps track of the number of references to the managed object using a reference count.
- Copy Semantics: Supports copy construction and assignment, allowing multiple shared pointers to manage the same object.
- Move Semantics: Supports move construction and assignment, efficiently transferring ownership of the managed object.
- Operator Overloading: Overloaded operators for member access (->) and comparison (== and !=).
- Factory Function: Provides a make static member function for convenient creation of shared pointers.

Memory Management
The shared pointer automatically manages the memory of the dynamically allocated object. When the last reference to the object is released, the object is deleted.


Usage Description
The provided code appears to be a part of a kernel or low-level system and involves operations related to an IDE device, Ext2 file system, shared pointers, memory mapping, and asynchronous computation. Let's break down the usage based on the code snippets:

1. IDE and Ext2 initialization:

auto ide = Shared<Ide>::make(1);
auto fs = Shared<Ext2>::make(ide);

Initializes an IDE device (representing the first IDE device) and an Ext2 file system using shared pointers for memory management.

2. File System Operations:

auto root = fs->root;
auto idk = fs->find(root, "idk.txt");
Retrieves the root directory of the file system and searches for the file "idk.txt" in the Ext2 file system.

3. Memory Mapping:

uint32_t* x = (uint32_t*) naive_mmap(idk->size_in_bytes(), idk, 0);
Maps the content of the "idk.txt" file into memory. The pointer x points to the beginning of the mapped memory.

4. Debug Printing and Unmapping:

Debug::printf("*** x == %x\n", x);
Debug::printf("%s\n", x);
naive_munmap((void*)x);
Prints the value of the pointer x and the content of the mapped memory. Then, unmaps the file that was previously mapped into memory.

5. Asynchronous Computation (Thread Creation):

auto thread = future<bool>([x] {
    uint32_t* val = (uint32_t*) naive_mmap(1, Shared<Node>{}, 0);
    Debug::printf("*** val == %x\n", val);
    return true;
});
Creates a new thread (asynchronous computation) using the future class. The lambda function in the thread maps a single page of memory into the thread's address space.

6. Thread Wait:

thread->get();
Waits for the asynchronous computation represented by the thread future to complete.

7. Kernel Main Function:

void kernelMain(void) {
    // ... (previous code)
}
This is the entry point of the kernel, where the described operations are taking place.
